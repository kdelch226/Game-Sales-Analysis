Video Game Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing global video game sales data from 1980 to 2020. The goal is to explore sales trends across platforms, genres, and regions, as well as identify the factors that most influence global sales. The analysis includes several key steps, such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the factors influencing video game sales. By examining the sales of different platforms and genres over time, we can uncover patterns and relationships that may help predict future sales. The analysis uses machine learning to model and predict future global sales based on historical data.

Data Exploration and Visualizations
The data exploration phase involved analyzing the dataset to identify trends and insights. This includes:

-Top 5 platforms with the highest global sales: We identified the platforms that have generated the most global sales.
-Sales trends over time: We examined the time periods that saw the highest global sales and explored how sales have evolved over the years.
-Regional sales analysis: We analyzed sales trends across four major regions: North America (NA), Europe (EU), Japan (JP), and Other regions, to understand regional preferences and shifts.
-Sales evolution by platform and genre: We explored how different platforms and game genres performed over time, highlighting the most popular and least successful combinations.

Predictive Modeling
In this phase, we built a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict future global sales for video games. We used a pipeline to preprocess categorical variables (such as Genre, Publisher, and Platform) and trained a linear regression model. This model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess its performance.

Correlation Analysis
We performed correlation analysis to understand the relationship between categorical variables (Publisher, Genre, Platform) and global sales. The goal was to determine which factor had the most influence on sales, which can guide future predictions and business strategies.

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the video game industry, highlighting key trends in platform and genre popularity over the years. Although we found that platforms have the highest correlation with global sales, other factors like genre and publisher play important roles too. The predictive model built in this project can help stakeholders in the gaming industry forecast future sales and make data-driven decisions.
